# Xamarin 101 Tutorials

Heyo!

Welcome to the Xamarin 101 Tutorial code repository. This repository backs up the [Xamarin 101 Tutorials](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Xamarin-101?WT.mc_id=xamarin101-github-masoucou) that aired on Microsoft's Channel 9 during the summer of 2019. That's a long time ago you say? Don't worry - the concepts are still relevant.

This readme will walk you through  [Xamarin.Forms UI with XAML](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Xamarin-101/XamarinForms-UI-with-XAML-5-of-11?WT.mc_id=xamarin101-github-masoucou), [Xamarin.Forms MVVM with XAML](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Xamarin-101/XamarinForms-Navigation-with-XAML-7-of-11?WT.mc_id=xamarin101-github-masoucou), and Xamarin.Forms Navigation with XAML. These are episodes 5, 6, and 7.

There are more episodes in the series - a lot more. The first 4 are dedicated to explaining [what Xamarin is](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Xamarin-101/What-is-Xamarin-1-of-11?WT.mc_id=xamarin101-github-masoucou) and how to [install it on a Mac](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Xamarin-101/Installing-Xamarin-on-a-Mac-3-of-11?WT.mc_id=xamarin101-github-masoucou) and [PC](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Xamarin-101/Installing-Xamarin-on-a-PC-2-of-11?WT.mc_id=xamarin101-github-masoucou). And finally a [basic Xamarin.Forms solution structure](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Xamarin-101/Xamarin-Solution-Architecture-4-of-11?WT.mc_id=xamarin101-github-masoucou) that you'll see a lot.

There's really nothing to put in a readme about those, go watch the linked videos.

Episodes [8](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Xamarin-101/Single-Page-UI-in-C-8-of-11?WT.mc_id=xamarin101-github-masoucou), [9](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Xamarin-101/XamarinForms-MVVM-in-C-9-of-11?WT.mc_id=xamarin101-github-masoucou), and [10](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Xamarin-101/XamarinForms-Navigation-in-C-10-of-11?WT.mc_id=xamarin101-github-masoucou) deal with the exact same concepts as 5, 6, and 7 - but instead of using XAML, they do it with C#.

This repo will cover XAML, as that's the most popular way of building Xamarin.Forms apps today.
